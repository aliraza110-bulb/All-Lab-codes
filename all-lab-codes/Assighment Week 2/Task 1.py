# You are tasked with creating a basic grocery store checkout system using Python. The program will: 
# ∙ Ask the user for their name. 
# ∙ Allow the user to input the price of three grocery items they are purchasing. ∙ Calculate and display the total amount. 
# ∙ If the user enters an invalid value (such as a negative price or non-numeric input), the  system should handle the error and prompt the user to re-enter the correct price. ∙ Once the total is displayed, the program will ask if the user wants to apply a membership  discount. If yes, the total amount should be recalculated with a 10% discount. 

name=str(input("Enter Your Name :"))
print('::::::::::::::::::::::WELCOME Mr.',name,'::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::')
